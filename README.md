Python Bootcamp Milestone 1 - Tic Tac Toe

This is the "Milestone 1" project of course "Complete Python Bootcamp: Go from
zero to hero in Pyton".

Assignment is to create a Tic Tac Toe game in Python.

This version is quite simple, and I may revisit it at a later stage.
I have quite a few ideas to improve it, but I am eager to finish the assignment
and proceed with the course.
